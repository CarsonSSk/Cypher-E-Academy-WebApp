# SOEN342-Cypher-E-Academy  

## The Task 

  Develop an interface for a unique E-Academy platform. 
  
  E-Academy is a learning platform where students and tutors can obtain the necessary support for online tutoring. This platform puts students and compatible tutors in contact with one another. If desired, student parents may also be put in contact with their child's tutor(s).
  
  As there are multiple parties involved, there will be different kinds of users and each of these users will be permitted to perform certain tasks. The different kinds of users and their respective tasks are outlined below:
- Guests
  - request to register as a tutor
  - request to register as a student
  - access general platform sections
- Students (and/or parent/guardian):
  - request for tutoring lessons in a certain subject
  - connect to the shared board
  - upload/download documents
- Tutors
  - set meetings with their assigned student(s) (and the parent, if desired)
  - request to be assigned a student
- Administrator
  - select tutors
  - general management of tutors 
  - manage requests 

More functionalities to be discussed and added later.
